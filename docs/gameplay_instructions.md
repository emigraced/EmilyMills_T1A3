# Game Overview

Thanks for being here! If you're not familiar with The Sims, it's a sandbox game where you can create fully customisable people (called Sims) and control almost everything about their lives (for good or for evil!).

This command line version of the game enables players of The Sims to nostalgicly enjoy some of their favourite features in a text-based format... because why not? :)

## Create a Sim

Have some fun creating your Sim(s)! Choose their gender, life stage, trait, and name. Your Sim(s) are automatically saved, so you can continue with the game! 

## Choose a Sim to play

*You need to have created at least two Sims before you can proceed.*

First, select the Sim who will be initiating the interaction, then choose the receiving Sim. Next, choose what you would like the initiating Sim to do with the receiving Sim. Hold on to the edge of your seats, because the interaction may go sideways!

## Delete Sims

From a drop down menu, choose to delete any Sim from a list of Sims you have created. Be careful, because you cannot undo this! (If you accidentally enter the Delete Sims menu, arrow down to the bottom of the list to see an option to cancel and return to the main menu.)

## Read the Instructions

You're doing this right now! 

## Exit

Quit the game. Your Sims will be here when you return :)
