# Game Overview

Thanks for being here! If you're not familiar with The Sims, it's a sandbox game where you can create fully customisable people (called Sims) and control almost everything about their lives (for good or for evil!).

This command line version of the game enables players of The Sims to nostalgicly enjoy some of their favourite features in a text-based format... because why not? :)

## Create a Sim

Have some fun creating your Sim(s)! Choose their gender, life stage, personality trait, and name. Your Sims are automatically saved, so you can continue with the game! 

## Choose a Sim to play

*You need to have created at least two Sims before you can proceed.*

First, select the Sim who will be initiating the interaction, then choose the receiving Sim. Next, choose what you would like the initiating Sim to do with the receiving Sim. Hold on to the edge of your seats, because the interaction may go sideways!

## View Relationships

*At least two Sims need to have interacted before you can proceed.* 

From the home menu, you can choose to view a summary of the relationships your Sims are in. This summary will update as you continue gameplay, but will be reset once you exit the game.

## Read the Instructions

Huzzah, you're doing this right now! 

## Exit

Quit the game. Your Sims will be here when you return :)

## Bonus Tip!

If your Sims are getting out of hand, you can erase the Sim library and start afresh. To do this, exit the game and re-launch using the following code (but be careful, as this action cannot be undone)

`./index.rb [name] erase`
